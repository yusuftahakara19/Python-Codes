Text classification with genetic algorithm
 
 <hr>
<h2></h2>
In the text classification dataset containing at least 100 examples with 2 classes, individuals will consist of a list containing N words. The first part will mean belonging to the 1st class, and the last part will be to belong to the 2nd class.

If a sample individual is [“beautiful”, “amazing” …“awesome”][“awful”, “terrible” …“disgusting”)], this individual will classify 100 samples according to their inclusion of these words and achieve a classification success. This achievement value will be used as a fitness function.

It will be determined how many of the words in the classification text are in the 1st class and how many are in the 2nd class list, and action will be taken according to these values. In the event of a tie, the class can be determined randomly.

Initially, words will be randomly assigned to all individuals. Throughout the process, individuals' fitness values will be tried to be increased by applying processes such as crossover and random word change.

The word lists of individuals will be optimized by genetic algorithm.
